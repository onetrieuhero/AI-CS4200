To run the program:
1) go to src folder
2) In terminal enter the command javac Driver.java if doesn't work check to
    see if you are in the right directory
3) java Driver

NOTE: The code "SimulatedAnnealing sim = new SimulatedAnnealing();"
      is underlined red for some reason claiming "cannot be resolved to a type Java" 
      however the program could still be compiled and run just fine.  I don't know if this is 
      a VSCode issue or something else.
